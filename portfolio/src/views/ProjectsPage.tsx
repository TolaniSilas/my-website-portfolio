        <p>The best way to actually &quot;learn&quot; is by doing. By going down the rabbit hole on a tough problem and learning by building. My undergraduate years have instilled in me the spirit of a builder. I have spent an ample amount of time tinkering with solutions, performing independent research, building from scratch, and contributing to remarkable initiatives. I gravitate towards areas most people tend to shy away from - understanding the nuts and bolts of a solution and the knowledge needed to build from scratch - because that is mostly where the innovation lies. That insight provides the power not only to innovate but also to optimize.</p>
